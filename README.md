Binance Delisted Stock Trend
Project Overview
This project aims to leverage a trend observed in Binance when an exchange announces delisting of stocks. Typically, after such announcements, the prices of the affected stocks tend to plummet. The goal of this project is to track these stocks and capitalize on the price movements by enabling automated trading with stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms.

Purpose
When Binance announces the delisting of stocks, there is a trend where the price drops significantly within a certain timeframe, which allows private investors to sell stocks and earn a profit before the official delisting happens. This project automates the process of identifying such stocks, calculating the price movement, and executing trades based on the observed trend.

Workflow
The project consists of the following steps:

Data Collection:
The system monitors the Binance announcement board to identify stocks that are announced for delisting.

Stock Price Monitoring:
The current price of each identified stock is tracked in real-time. The system calculates the price change between the last close and the current price to decide if a position should be opened.

Order Execution & Risk Management:
Once a suitable position is identified, the system places a buy order and sets up stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms to manage the trade, ensuring potential profits are locked in while minimizing risks.

Features
Automated Stock Monitoring based on Binance delisting announcements
Real-time Price Tracking for affected stocks
Trade Execution with Stop-Loss and Take-Profit settings
Risk Management to safeguard investments
